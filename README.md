The following portal is built on Streamlit and OpenAI API and purposely set apart for Thesis submission. 

I extend my appreciation to my professors for enabling me to pursue my chosen thesis topic. Their support and guidance have been instrumental in shaping the development of this project. I am pleased to announce that the application built during my thesis is now available on this code space.

This accomplishment wouldn't have been possible without the encouragement and freedom to explore that my professors provided. I believe this application reflects the knowledge and skills gained throughout this academic endeavor. I look forward to its potential impact and invite others to explore and contribute to its development. Thank you to all who have supported me along this journey.
